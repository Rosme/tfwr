# The Followers: Rebooted

This is a rebooted version of the original [The Followers](https://github.com/Rosme/the-followers)

It will basically the same game, with a few additions. The purpose of this exercice is to put in application what I have learned in the last few years, and finally put what I've been wanting to put in it. Oh, and fix the bugs that are present.
